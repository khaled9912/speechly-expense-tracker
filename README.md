Built with React and it is a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, I have dealed with many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, is adding voice capabilities to the applications using Speechly.
